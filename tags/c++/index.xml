      <description>The C++ Game Engine (Name TBD) was created for my Game Engine Foundations course. This was a solo project that was developed throughout my semester with multiple iterations. Each iteration added new features and systems related to topics such as Collision Detection, Input Handling, Multithreading, Networking, Time Scale, Game-Object Models, Event Management, and Scripting. Over the course of the class, I developed two games using the engine: a multiplayer side-scroller platformer and a top-down survival game with enemy AI.</description>

      <description>Mecha Mania is a multiplayer first-person shooter inspired by Titanfall 2 and the Gundam franchise. The game is being developed in Unreal Engine 5 and will be available for Windows. Compete in a 3v3 team deathmatch where you must gather mech parts and obliterate the enemy team with your completed mech. Throughout the arena, you&amp;rsquo;ll have an arsenal of weapons and tools to help you stop the enemy team. Use your movement abilities, including wallrunning, sliding, and climbing, to traverse your environment and outmaneuver your enemies.</description>
