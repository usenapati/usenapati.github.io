      <description>The C++ Game Engine (Name TBD) was created for my Game Engine Foundations course. This was a solo project that was developed throughout my semester with multiple iterations. Each iteration added new features and systems related to topics such as Collision Detection, Input Handling, Multithreading, Networking, Time Scale, Game-Object Models, Event Management, and Scripting. Over the course of the class, I developed two games using the engine: a multiplayer side-scroller platformer and a top-down survival game with enemy AI.</description>
